# The accuracy plan, 2026-08-30

**What this is.** One ranked plan, replacing the ranked lists at the end of `EIGHT-ROCKETS.md` and
`METRE-LEVEL.md`, which were written against a state that has since moved and against each other.
Read this first; those two keep their reasoning and their measurements.

**It exists because four investigations landed at once** — the long-range logs, the guidance chain,
the KSA corpus and the backlog itself — and between them they moved the top of the list from "tune a
constant" to "there is a bug, and the engine has a lever nobody used".

## Where it stands, measured

| | 2,000 km | 12,902 km |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flights | 96 of 96 scoring | 324 across three nights |
| median miss | **99 m** | **6,664 m** |
| p90 | 198 m | 28,652 m |
| within a group of six | **5 m** | 6 m |
| cutoff residual | 0.240 m/s | 0.135-0.290 m/s |
| shape | unimodal, CV 0.58 | **bimodal**, CV 1.08 |

**The burn is equally good at both ranges.** What differs is what the geometry does with it and, at
long range, a bug.

## 1. The long-range bimodality is one rocket's timewarp thrown over the others

**Not a heavy tail — two populations, and the separation is exogenous.** Pooled over 324 flights,
log-miss is 25% at a **60 m** median and 75% at **8.81 km**, with a trough holding 7.4% of the mass
between 0.25 and 2.5 km. A two-component mixture beats one at LRT 245.8 against a bootstrap maximum
of 11.6 under the unimodal null.

**The good long-range mode sits on top of the entire 2,000 km control.** 0.02-0.15 km against
0.04-0.25 km. So there is no long-range accuracy problem: a long shot that avoids one event is as
accurate as a short one.

The event, from `~/shots/interlock-more/006`, 130 milliseconds wide:

```
04:39:19.908  GeoSat FAT    ... longest step of the burn  33 ms
04:39:19.909  warping to within 4:44 of the release point on GeoSat FAT
04:39:20.039  GeoSat FAT 2  ... longest step of the burn 205 ms
04:39:20.039  GeoSat FAT 3  ... 205 ms          (and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
```

One rocket finishes its burn, fires KSA's auto-warp, and the seven **still burning** get 205 ms
steps. Their one-frame velocity quantum goes from 0.081 m/s to 1.675 m/s. Misses: 0.68 km for the
one that triggered it, 14-37 km for the rest.

`Ksa/IcbmComputer.cs`'s `CanWarpAhead` asks `!NeedsShortSteps` of **this computer only**, and its own
comment names the consequence: *"WarpPolicy cannot slow the world at all while an auto-warp is
running, so a warp started over the top of one is a warp nothing can rein in."* It is the identical
one-world/several-flights mistake `Sim/WorldSpeed.cs` was written to fix for the speed path, left
unfixed on the auto-warp path.

**The evidence it is causal rather than correlated**, all from the logs:

* Dose-response with no exceptions: 33 ms -> 2.02 km (56% bad); 34-60 -> 9.97 (96%); 61-100 -> 11.45
  (100%); 101-160 -> 20.89 (100%); >160 -> 34.85 (100%). Every one of the 96 control flights is 33 ms.
* In **28 of 28** contaminated shots the flights sort perfectly by cutoff time into a run of 33 ms
  then a run of >33 ms, never interleaved — a world-level switch at one instant, not a property of a
  rocket.
* Which rockets are hit is decided by where the *controlled* craft sits in the cutoff order, which
  is an accident: rho(controlled craft's cutoff rank, flights contaminated) = **-0.89**, and
  rho(flights contaminated, shot median) = **+0.93**.
* Within-shot matched pairs: the >33 ms group is worse in **17 of 17**, median 5.5x, sign p=1.5e-5.

**And the documented 175x seat gradient was this.** Stratified by cutoff rank the effect is flat and
large (7.1x, 5.5x, 7.9x); pooled rank-sum z = -13.6. Seniority was never the variable.

**Do the diagnostic first.** Extend the existing warp line with how many other computers in the
world report `NeedsShortSteps`, and their names. It has to read 7,7,7,6,5,4,3 in the 28 contaminated
shots and 0 in the 14 clean ones. A shot logging 0 still-burning computers that still produces
>33 ms steps kills the hypothesis. Then fold `!NeedsShortSteps` over `IcbmComputers.All`, the way
`WorldSpeed.Slowest` folds the speed requests.

**The second branch needs no warp and stays open.** Even on a clean burn, `owed at the split` is
1.56 m/s at 12,902 km against 0.49 at 2,000, and about half the time that trips the same 20 s
clearance abandonment (82 of 183, median 4.65 km). At 2,000 km the correction finishes 19.5 s after
the split and the bus's closest approach is at 21.6 s — it re-enters *after* release, so the same
physics costs nothing. That is a knife-edge on a 20 s constant, not a margin.

## 2. The engine can cut an engine off between frames, and the mod drives the branch that cannot

`ActiveNozzle.ComputeThrustMod` returns `clamp((ThrustTime - intraStepTime) / dt, 0, 1)` and it is
applied to force, torque, mass rate **and** propellant draw. An engine commanded to burn for less
than a step delivers exactly that fraction of the step's impulse. It is the only sub-substep event
resolution in the vehicle sim and it is the one this mod needs.

The mod never reaches it because `VehicleCommand` drives the manual branch, where
`FlightComputer.ComputeControl` sets `EngineBurnDuration = EngineOn ? PositiveInfinity : 0.0`.
Infinity or zero — hence a whole-frame quantum, which is the term the entire throttle ramp exists to
divide down.

The route in is public and lands inside the window `AttitudeHook` already owns: `FlightComputer.Burn`
(a `BurnTarget?` of public mutable fields) and `FlightComputer.BurnMode`, both copied by
`FlightComputer.CopyFrom` so they survive the double buffer exactly as `AttitudeMode` does. The
engine's own `UpdateBurnTarget` recomputes the duration from the rocket equation every evaluation and
closes the loop on **measured** delta-v — `ReadMeasurements` accumulates `DeltaVelocityCci` per
sub-step, so it is an accelerometer loop rather than a prediction.

**Hand over late and with a small target.** At a 20 m/s remaining target the float ULP in
`BurnTarget`'s `float3` fields is ~2e-6 m/s; handing over 7 km/s puts the cancellation floor at
~8e-4. Either is inside the 0.005 m/s column that gates rungs C and D of `METRE-LEVEL.md`.

Three costs, all verified and none fatal:

* The flight computer takes attitude past ignition (`AttitudeTrackTarget = PositiveDv`), which points
  along remaining delta-v — what `HoldDirectionFrames` approximates — but overrides the frozen command.
* `Vehicle.PrepareWorker` forces `EngineOn = false` while `BurnMode == Auto`, so returning to Manual
  needs a re-ignition.
* `SolveBurnThrottle` throttles down for a short burn on its own, which is the lever the mod ramps by
  hand.

**No second Harmony patch.** Public fields written from the existing prefix.

## 3. The correction loop stops itself, on constants measured at another range

At 2,000 km **93 of 96** corrections ended on `payback`:

```csharp
double nextCycleCosts = _lastCycleSeconds * HoldingCostsMetresPerSecond;   // 6 s x 26 = 156 m
if (now.PredictedMissMetres <= nextCycleCosts) return Finish(...);
```

Median 99 m, p90 198 m — the distribution sits on the threshold. **The shot is not
residual-limited; it is stopping-rule-limited.** The release probe predicts 0.1 km and the warheads
land at 0.099, so the predictor knows the miss and the loop stops anyway.

`HoldingCostsMetresPerSecond = 26` comes from "8.421 km applied at cutoff and 5.672 km at +106 s" —
`(8421-5672)/106 = 25.9` — measured on a **3,459 km** shot. `SteadyWithinDegrees = 2.0` was
calibrated on that same shot. Both scale with the ejection kick's leverage, which is a property of
the trajectory. Applied at 2,000 km the payback rule stops the loop with the whole miss still on the
table.

**The fix is to derive it, not to lower it.** The remaining flight time and the arrival angle are
both known at runtime, and the leverage is what `AimAuthority` already prices.

Two further defects in the same file, both verified:

**`_worseFor` counts cumulatively where its calibration assumes a run.** It resets only on a new
best, so a cycle inside the +/-250 m dead band neither resets nor increments and twelve accumulates
across the whole flight. The doc's justification — *"the worsening patch is five cycles long...
Twelve is twice that patch"* — is a run-length argument, and the measured cliff is right beside it:
3/4/5 -> 15.74/18.99/22.36 km, 6 and above -> 1.15 km. A cumulative counter behaves like a smaller
run threshold, which is the wrong side of that cliff.

**`Resume()` seeds `_response = 1.0`, the floor of the clamp and so the largest step the loop can
take** — on the one cycle carrying the entire cutoff error, before anything has been measured.
Everywhere else seeds `1.0 / Gain` = 4. And the file argues against itself: `Resume` says the
fixed-arrival coast plant moves the impact "about what the aim did", while `Observe` twenty lines
above says that on a latched arrival "the impact moves several times further — at which point a half
is above the stability limit". The arithmetic favours `Observe`: 36 km of miss times the 0.53 m/s
per km aim cost is 19.1 m/s of pass-one demand, against a recorded 19.26.

## 4. Throughput is a setting, and the ladder's gate was mis-read

`App.Run` computes `dtPlayer = min(elapsed, 1f / GameSettings.Current.Simulation.MinTargetFrameRate)`.
The 33.3 ms per frame that `METRE-LEVEL.md` 5b treats as fixed is `MinTargetFrameRate = 30`, a public
mutable field with a 1-10000 UI slider and a TOML key. It appears again in the solver governor's
`_achievedSpeedFraction`, so lowering it raises the step **and** relaxes the deadline.

On 5b's own measurement — 8 rockets, 33 vehicles, 78.7 ms frame, 0.41x sim rate —
`minTargetFrameRate = 10` leaves `dtPlayer` unclamped and gives **1.00x instead of 0.41x: 2.4x for a
config line**, with no change to frame time.

The cost is a coarser step wherever the step matters, and the mod already owns the instrument for
that: `WorldSpeed.ForStep` turns "I want this step" into a speed request, so the burn and trim can
hold today's step by asking for a speed below 1 while ascent and coast run long.

Three more, all public or config:

* `orbitSolvers` defaults to `ProcessorCount / 2`, giving 5 vehicle worker threads of 16 — consistent
  with the 412% of a 1600% budget 5b measured. Boot-time setting.
* The per-vehicle render-data pass runs **four times a frame**: viewports 1, 4 and 5 are constructed
  with `IsOffscreen = true` and it is never cleared, and `UpdateRenderData` culls only on a 1-pixel
  angular test with no frustum cull. Clearing it on the three hidden viewports takes four passes to one.
* Commanding attitude forces a vehicle **off rails** for as long as it is commanded, putting it on the
  sub-stepped full-physics path instead of a closed-form Kepler evaluation. A bus pointed through a
  25-minute coast is integrated the expensive way throughout — a candidate for 5b's unattributed
  ~2.0 ms per vehicle, and cheap to test against `SolverLoad`.

`Profiler.MainThread` is public, and `Program.OnFrame` already tags `UpdateVehicleRenderData` and the
rest. 5b says the missing piece "wants a profiler rather than another guess" — it is there.

## The ranked plan

| # | Do | Cost | Worth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Diagnostic**: log how many other computers need short steps when the warp fires | 1 shot | confirms or kills item 1 |
| **2** | **Fix**: fold `!NeedsShortSteps` over every computer, as `WorldSpeed.Slowest` does | 12 paired shots | 12,902 km: **6,664 -> ~85 m** on the clean cell |
| **3** | **Diagnostic**: log the release residual and `_response` per flight, unconditionally | 0 shots | the budget cannot be closed without it |
| **4** | Measure `dMiss/dV` at both flown geometries in `ErrorBudgetTests` | 0 shots, minutes | settles what the residual is worth; every other item's interpretation depends on it |
| **5** | Derive `HoldingCostsMetresPerSecond` from flight time and arrival angle | 12 paired shots | 2,000 km: **99 -> plausibly 10-30 m** |
| **6** | `_worseFor` as a run counter; headless counterfactual over `RoughGround` first | 0 shots then 12 | long range, if `settled` stops being modal |
| **7** | Seed `Resume()` from the burn's last measured response | 12 paired shots | long range; decomposes the pass-one trim demand |
| **8** | `minTargetFrameRate`, `orbitSolvers`, the three offscreen viewports, coast off-rails | hours | **2.4x or better throughput**, which every row above pays for in shots |
| **9** | Hand the terminal fraction of the burn to `FlightComputer.Burn` | days | removes the frame quantum outright; gates rungs C and D |
| **10** | `AimWithinTrimBudget` to 24 shots, **pre-declared** | 24 shots | 0.85x [0.53, 1.14], the only arm that has never lost |

**1-4 need no flying.** 8 makes everything after it cheaper and should come before 5-7 if a night is
short.

**Score every arm on the terminator table, never the median.** A median cannot see mass moving
between two modes, and the baseline swings 2.7x between sessions.

## Stale lines, ranked by what they close off

1. **`METRE-LEVEL.md` §5: the 200 fps ceiling does not exist.** `Program : App` binds `KSA.App`,
   whose `Run()` has no `FrameLimit` and no sleep. `Core.App.FrameLimit = 200` is in a class KSA never
   subclasses, and `Core.Time.Update()` — the only reader of `Time.FrameLimit` — is called nowhere, so
   `display.fpslimit` does nothing. Vsync is the only limiter. The line reads as a wall that is not there.
2. **`METRE-LEVEL.md` 5b: "throughput is bought by frame time and by nothing else."** See item 4; the
   conclusion that the ladder stops at rung C should be re-derived.
3. **`IcbmProgram.cs` and `CLAUDE.md`: "an engine can only be shut down on a frame boundary."** True of
   the mod's command path, false of the engine — and stating it as an engine constraint closes off item 9.
4. **The seven-degree arrival**, asserted in `ARRIVAL-ANGLE.md`, `KINETIC-FLOOR.md`, `METRE-LEVEL.md`
   and `IcbmConfig.cs`. The flown geometry arrives at 13.6-17.5 degrees. `METRE-LEVEL`'s ladder and
   `KINETIC-FLOOR`'s two columns are priced off the seven.
5. **`KSA-TERRAIN.md`: "there is no raycast, no collider query."** `BoundingVolumeHierarchy.LookupBvhDirection`
   is a public ray query, and there is a Bepu triangle collider on a 2 m grid within 8 m of clearance.
6. **`accurate: true` degrades silently to the coarse answer** when `TerrainModifiersRenderData` is
   null — the loop is bounded by `?.NumModifiers`, so a null runs the body zero times and skips
   erosion, detail and the launch-site levelling decals with no log line. Call
   `SetupModifierRenderData()` when a body is first resolved and assert it in the world dump.
7. **`EIGHT-ROCKETS.md`: "the keep-out interlock is provably dead."** It shipped on, resolved at
   0.49x, p=0.017.
8. **`VehicleCommand.cs`: "KSA exposes no way to set a throttle outright."** True of the manual
   channel; `PlannedBurnThrottle` is solved by the engine in `BurnMode.Auto`.

## Dead — do not spend on these

`TrimCeilingFromBudget` (harmful: 0 of 32 payback against 12, four shots at 54-105x).
`SeparationClearance.TimeoutSeconds` 20 -> 25 (resolved 1 of 16, and `clearance` is 0 of 96 endings now).
Tightening `AimCorrection.SteadyMetres` (worse at every value: 100 -> 2,329 m, 25 -> 2,568).
`MaxResponse` (6/12/24/60 bit-identical) and `ImprovedByMetres` (50/250/1000 identical).
Per-sub-step gravity alone (lost 3/3; only flyable paired with the 1 ms sub-step).
Every tube-cant item — the bus was straightened, all six axes are `(1,0,0)`, and the flown 5 m
within-group spread confirms it against the 233 m cant would give.
Never freezing the aim (lost 5.7x; the freeze is load-bearing).

## Ranked highly on reasoning since refuted — the pattern to watch

`payback` as a lever (it is a selection effect: the rule only fires under ~156 m).
`trim` as the dominant terminator implying `TrimCeilingFromBudget` (attacking the named terminator
cost the good ending).
The 20 degree arrival floor (priced against a 7 degree baseline that was already 13.6).
"The clearance never succeeds" (the absence of a log line measured the logger).
The 24 ms slow-regime screen (29.8 ms gave 0 passes one night and 2 another).

**Five of these five were counts or absences read as mechanisms.** The terminator table is a
diagnosis, not a lever, and an instrument with one output cannot tell a cause from a consequence.
